 In these 4 python files, I wanted to show my Python knowledge (I know it‘s not much) which I gained during my self-learning. 
 There is a long road ahead of me in the Python direction and this is where I start :)

amazon_scraper.py - Scrapes info from Amazon and saves the info to a CSV file.
file_renamer.py – Renames all files in the given directory.
generator.py  - player have to guess a random number. The computer helps by saying it is higher or lower.
snake.py – my learning project to understand OOP.
